This project is in the attic
============================

Due to a change in focus, I'm not actively maintaining this project any longer. I'll happily merge any patch that looks reasonable; or, if you're interested in taking over the project, `get in touch <mailto:russell@pybee.org>`__.

Cassowary
=========

A pure Python implementation of the `Cassowary constraint-solving algorithm`_.
Cassowary is the algorithm that forms the core of the OS X and iOS visual
layout mechanism.

Quickstart
----------

Cassowary is compatible with both Python 2 or Python 3. To install Cassowary
in your virtualenv, run::

    $ pip install cassowary

Then, in your Python code, you can create and solve constraint systems. See
`the documentation`_ for examples of what this looks like in
practice.
