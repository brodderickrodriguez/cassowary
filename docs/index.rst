Quickstart
----------

Cassowary is compatible with both Python 2 or Python 3. To install Cassowary
in your virtualenv, run::

    $ pip install cassowary

Then, in your Python code, you can create and solve constraint systems. See
:doc:`the documentation <topics/examples>` for examples of what this looks like in
practice.
